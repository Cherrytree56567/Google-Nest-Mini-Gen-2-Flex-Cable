# September 9th: Got the Footprints working!

I was able to measure the flex cable and put it in KiCad. The measuring was pretty difficult since it was really small, so I just put a ruler under the flex cable exposed pins and took a photo. From there I just used an online program to measure it.

# September 10th: Wired and JLCPCB!

I was able to use vias to make a Type B Flex PCB so that the pins are on either side. I was also able to get it on JLC PCB for a price. It isn't as expensive as I thought. I was also able to do a ground fill for it. I havent measured the thickness yet, I think it is 0.1mm. The measurements for the pins are the following.
 - 0.6mm padding
 - 0.25mm pins
 - 0.35mm pins padding
